This WooCommerce payment gateway plugin accepts account information for you to process Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments.

== Description ==

This plugin is very straight forward. It provides a checkout option for a customer to enter their bank account number, routing number and choose the account type (savings or checking). When the customer checks out, the account information is added to the admin email as well as the notes on the order. The customer email also has the last 4 digits of the account number for their own records.

You can then submit this information through your normal means of accepting EFTs.
