# woocommerce-pure-eft
A WooCommerce payment gateway plugin for WordPress. It accepts account information from users for you to process Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments.

A bank account number, routing number and type of account are requested during checkout. This information is then sent to the admin and saved to the order. This plugin simply collects the information so that someone can use it to complete an EFT.
